How It Works:

Thresholds: Set the minimum thresholds for impressions, clicks, CTR, and CR at the top of the script.
Metrics Monitoring: The script runs daily (yesterday’s data) and checks each campaign’s performance.
Email Alert: If any metric drops below your predefined threshold, it sends an alert email with the details.

Instructions:

Go to your Google Ads account.
Navigate to Tools & Settings > Scripts.
Create a new script, copy and paste the code above.
Set your thresholds and email recipient at the top.
Save and authorize the script.
Schedule it to run daily so you can stay on top of your campaigns!
